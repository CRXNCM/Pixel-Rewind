## 🧠 Concept Summary

# Pixel Rewind: 
Echo of the AI is a side-scrolling 2D platform shooter with retro pixel-art aesthetics, combining elements from Mario and Contra with modern AI features. The player is aided by an adaptive AI companion who learns from the player's behavior and helps them overcome increasingly difficult, glitch-infested levels in a corrupted digital world.

# 🤖 AI Companion

# 🧬 Behavior

Learns from your play style (e.g., how you deal with enemies, preferred routes).

Recommends actions ("try jumping now," "an enemy's ahead").

Can change personality:

Logical: Efficient tips.

Emotional: Encouraging or sarcastic.

Aggressive: Pushes you to fight more.

# 🔧 AI Technologies

Unity ML-Agents Toolkit for behavior learning.

ChatGPT API (or local LLM) for dialogue generation.

Behavior Trees to manage different personalities.

#🕵️ Echo Mechanic (Rewind)

When you die, you can press R to rewind and spawn an AI-generated echo of yourself.

Each "Echo" repeats your last actions and helps fight enemies.

Stack multiple echoes on tough levels.

## 👾 Enemy Types

# 🤡 Glitch Slime

Basic jumping enemy.

Evolves to split into two after first defeat.

## 🎨 Art & Audio

# 🎨 Art Style

8-bit/16-bit pixel art.

Use Aseprite or pixel-art generator AI like Pixelicious.

CRT visual filters, screen shake, glitch effects.

# 🎧 Sound Design

Chiptune soundtrack (use BeepBox or Bosca Ceoil).

Stable Diffusion (DreamBooth or PixArt-Alpha) for AI-generated retro textures or NPCs.

# 💬 Dialogue System

Dialogue boxes pop up from your AI companion.

Player can choose responses (A/B/C).
